# Temperature Converter üå°Ô∏è

This project is developed as part of my internship at **Prodigy Infotech**. It is **Task No. 01**, where I was assigned to create a web-based Temperature Converter. The application is built with Java Spring Boot for the backend and uses Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The converter allows users to easily convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Reaumur. The design focuses on providing a user-friendly, responsive interface to ensure accurate and efficient temperature conversions.

Follow the instructions below to run this project locally:

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have **Java 11** or above installed.
2. Install **Maven** for managing dependencies.
3. Set up your IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, or any other Java IDE).

### Steps
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/temperature-converter.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd temperature-converter
    ```

3. Open the project in your IDE and let Maven download the required dependencies.

4. Build the project:

## Usage

1. Enter a **temperature value** in the input field.
2. Select the **unit** from which you want to convert (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit).
3. Select the **unit** to which you want to convert.
4. Click the **Convert** button to see the result.

The converted temperature will be displayed under the form.

## Conversion Formulas

Here are the formulas used for converting between different temperature units:

- **Celsius to Fahrenheit**: (¬∞C √ó 9/5) + 32
- **Fahrenheit to Celsius**: (¬∞F ‚àí 32) √ó 5/9
- **Celsius to Kelvin**: ¬∞C + 273.15
- **Kelvin to Celsius**: K ‚àí 273.15
- **Reaumur to Celsius**: ¬∞R√© √ó 1.25
